"So let me just say this hot sauce is incredible! I like spicy stuff and this is just the right amount. We use it on anything and we have been through so many bottles. The heat is enough to make you enjoy it, but not to hot you can’t stand it. We did try the black label which is hotter and it’s also amazing but I like this one better. We normally put this on our salmon and it’s fantastic."
"This is my new favorite hot sauce. Wow! So good, heat comes on slow so you get to taste the great flavor."
I love this stuff. It's the perfect amount of heat for me. Highly recommended.
"This has a solid kick with excellent flavor. I believe 12/10 is being a bit deceiving, but this hot sauce did leave my throat warm. My bed is still clean, fortunately. I'm definitely a fan of the flavor!"
"Plenty of ""heat"" but not to the point where you lose flavor. My son likes very hot sauces and I bought him a bottle. It passed his ""heat"" and ""flavor"" taste right away. Recommended if you like HOT but still want to taste the flavor."
A sweet-heat style sauce. Very happy with this one. Will be ordering for friends.
Tastes amazing - event people who don't like hot sauce thought it tasted good - they died after but before it hit they enjoyed it 
"Even through the heat, the flavor is amazing. They were all in the same basket until this!! Nothing compares."
"I love this hot sauce. It has just the right amount of ""heat""."
Best hot sauce around. Great flavour and hot enough to rock your socks!!
"The spiciness doesn't quite cash the check the name cuts, but I love the stuff. Great flavor, good spiciness, and it goes well on pretty much everything! "
"We love this sauce, tasty and will blow yer socks off. More please!"
Love hot sauces. Unique not the typical grocery store sauces. How hot it too hot????? This really is HOT! Just a kiss will spice up your life anything more just scorches your taste buds. Great taste from W Australia. Buy it it will last forever.
Great. I slept in the Shower for two nights and wore newspaper diapers to the office
This hotsauce is delicious! A combination of a tolerable heat and taste. I will gift a bottle to my friend to get her hooked on this too.
"Great depth of flavor! ""Hot"" but not over the top. Fantastic in a Bloody Mary. Wonderful!"
"Certainly hot. But tasted very very good aswell, which is hard to find. Both hot, and tasted good as hell. Will buy again no doubt "
The sauce has great heat without an over powering taste of vinegar. Goes great on everything!
"If you're a fan of hotter hot sauce, I'd give this a try. The taste carries really well. As they mention... It's amazing on eggs!"
"I really like this hot sauce. I bought it rather quickly without much research - I needed one more item to get free shipping. I buy and use lots of different hot sauces and this one ranks in top three. Great for kicking up wings, cheese & crackers, pizza and even on Vienna sausages. It's hot but not burn your tongue off hot. Will buy again."
Great flavor and good heat -- actually expected it to be a little hotter.
We used first at a barbecue it is fantastic with every style of meat
"Sawce is hawt. It also has good flavor along with nice heat. You will not shat the bed, but will have a delicious time. Wish it were cheaper, I think I've used a third of it in a couple weeks already. Going to go fast."
"It has a really nice kick to it. Pretty hot but not so hot that you will be freaking out. This is about as hot as I like it while still being able to put a lot of it on my food. It has a really interesting consistency. It is thick, with lots of seeds all throughout, but looks and smells incredibly fresh. You can tell this sauce is high quality regardless of smell or taste. It just looks homemade. What really makes this sauce stand out though is the flavor. I've tried my fair share of hot sauces, but this one I would easily put in my top 5. It is an explosion of fresh peppery goodness in your mouth. It doesn't really lean too much on one side of any flavor profile. I can't classify it as ""carribean"" or ""bbq"". It is a little bit on the fresh tangy side I would say but has a lot more depth than that. It is savory yet refreshing and sweet at the same time. Very versatile. Definitely going to be one of my staples from now on."
The flavor of this sauce is excellent! It packs some heat but not the kind of that's going to blow your head off. It's my new favorite. The flavor profile of this sauce is unique and delicious. I wish I could get it in a bigger container.
I gave these sauce as a gift. Everybody who is tried this thing it is going great
OMG this stuff is amazing. great flavor and heat. easily on my favorites list now. will definitely order more of this.
"I'm a spice pansy, made me wish for death. Didn't have that horrible vinegar taste most spicy sauces have."
"Awesome! It hot, make no mistake about it but the flavor is great. It’s not the hot that lingers either, feel the burn, great taste and it moves on a short time later. I’ll be buying it again."
"Actually a very good tasting sauce!! Bought for the name, now for the taste!"
"The way the glass bottle was protected,the glass jar didn’t fair too well...it’s leaking."
"The heat level and flavor of the sauce were both perfect. Most sauces are either hot with no flavor or full of flavor and no heat. I just made a Latin dish with lobster and shrimp, used this sauce and it blew my mind. I am truly satisfied with this sauce especially since it’s all natural."
"This stuff is not only a conversation piece, but it tastes really good, yes it’s hot if a lot is used at one time, but in moderation it’s great for me."
"I love hot sauce, I've tried a lot (72 yo) and I gotta say, It Is the best I have ever had. Now, I know everyone has different tastes but if you are reading this ... YOU MUST TRY IT !!!!"
Nice size bottle.. Good flavor and then the heat hits.. Ohh weee! Its not there hottest but it's plenty enough.. Like a kick in the mouth!!
I bought this for my sons and it lived up to my expectations! They all thought it was very hot and liked the flavor!
Product was delivered quickly. Has a nice fruity flavor. Lots of heat. Very good quality. Have recommended to several friends. They like it too.
Love this hot sauce! I eat a quesadilla every day just so I can have the hot sauce. So good!
"My husband is a HUGE hot sauce/hot peppers junkie! I decided to buy him this sauce to see if it held up to its name. Gotta say that he was hooked after his first taste! He absolutely loved the flavor, as well as the heat! Most of his hot sauces are nothing but pure heat and instant burn, but he said this one was actually packed with amazing flavor and taste. This was by far the the best he's ever had! It was obviously made by a woman who appreciates flavorful ingredients, and not just the burn! Can't wait to buy him another bottle when he finishes this one! "
Bought this for my husband he says flavor is very good and pretty darn hot. So I am sure I will have to buy more. Good product!
"Way too expensive, but delicious. I think most hot sauce makers concentrate on either heat or flavor - rarely both. This one is super hot and tasty."
Hot (made me sweat like Bill after Hillary lost). Good flavor if you appreciate hot stuff.
"This hot sauce tastes pretty good, unique, and it's nice that it's made with healthy ingredients. I bought this as a gag gift but ended up keeping it myself because I'm a hot sauce enthusiast. The heat level is nice and high, a little goes a long way and it has a taste that is unusual but pleasant. I would definitely buy this product again."
"It's some of the best hot I ever had. wheeeeeewu. great flavor, gotta be easy."
"This stuff is HOT. It has a great flavor and I keep coming back even though it hurts. The pain is somewhat of a creeper...you know it’s coming and there’s nothing you can do. It has never caused me to shit the bed, but it is a good laxative and you need to be prepared, should you consume enough to feel the urge. It is kind of expensive, but has more flavor and heat compared to similar products. I will purchase again, although this bottle will last another year or so."
I am confused as to why it contains goji berry...maybe it adds to the flavor? I did smile when I saw that it contains superfoods.
"Never had a hot sause that tasted this good. Just a warning before eating, put plastic sheets on bed, and warn your sleeping partner. "
"I'm a hot sauce guru and chili head for going on 30 years. I've tried them all..mostly. Some have been pretty flat or clones of that vinegary stuff from Louisiana, and others are just pure, gratuitous pain. It's taken a long time but finally we're getting the good stuff...respectable heat for us with the disease, AND lots of really good flavor to go with it. I found out about this from of course Teddie B (FBI), who has left us for...well who knows. But before he disappeared he reviewed this sauce and said it was not to be missed. He was 100% right. I ordered this one along with its milder little sister 7/10, and they're both my new favorites!! The name, which is just the best ever, is of course meant to be a warning shot across the bow of lightweights because this one is a real tongue burner. But the other punch you get is the awesome Bunsters flavor, which is very similar (if not exactly the same) as their 7/10 sauce. For me this one is very addictive and so I've learned to use only a few drops every couple of days or i would end up buying this stuff by the case. The only drawback of course is the price! At $18 a bottle I can only afford to buy it maybe 2-3 times a year. They need to find a way to get the price down to about $10. Other than that, its awesome sauce!"
"This sauce gets hot quickly, the heat level is high but still enjoyable I have never tried a hot sauce that as soon as it touches your mouth it is imediatly hot."
"Saw Ted Barrus review this sauce (and the original) and thought I'd give them a try. This sauce, while not the hottest I've ever had, definitely has heat to it. The flavor is really good; the goji berries, orange juice and veggies give this sauce a flavor that I've grown to love. My only gripe is that it's pretty pricey, at almost $20 a bottle, but if you're looking for a sauce that both tastes good and packs the heat, buy in faith. This sauce is amazing. And check out the original sauce, too. It's even better!"
"Quite tasty sauce and not too, too hot. Very nice flavor and we use it on everything."
"My favourite hot sauce to date. I bought this a replacement for a bottle of Dave's insanity sauce. Honestly it's not a replacement, it's much better. Dave's (and other extract sauces) are a lot hotter, but don't taste very good. I love spicy foods, and I find this to be a good ""hot"" level sauce. I wouldn't say it's extreme or mega. If you can handle the Tabasco hot habanero variant, I find this to be similar in heat."
"It's been said before and I'll say it again: This hot sauce is tasty. Lightly sweet and tangy, followed by a little salt and a smoky earthiness. It's hard to compare the taste to anything else. Goes well with just about anything, or a little by itself. Heat is a very subjective thing, I eat hot sauce by itself for fun, grow chilies, and always order extra-hot in thai restaurants. Scorpion heat brings the sauce together very nicely. Heat level is just right for me. I would pour this liberally on anything. "
"I bought this as kind of a gag stocking stuffer for my husband, but he has used almost the whole bottle! He love it, will buy more"
"The flavor is amazing then the heat comes and it is fantastic! I bought this for my boy who loves hot sauce, the hotter the better!!!"
Love it. Posted a review befor4e but guess it did not go through. I said I didn't like it cuz I put it on something that tasted bad. It is amazing!
"I bought this hot sauce for my fiancé , I am not one to eat hot stuff but he really enjoyed it and eats it on everything. He loves this hot sauce! I will be buying it again once he runs out."
"I gave this as a gift to a friend who is a hot sauce enthusiast and he was enthusiastic to say the least! Loved it, and is anxious to move up to the black label version. He said it was a substantial upgrade on his usual grocery store brands, and had a good laugh at the name."
"Love this hot sauce. Not too hot and has great flavor. I’ve used it in chili, eggs, Bloody Marys and many other things."
Very good hot sauce. Think I'll always keep it around. Hot but not extremely hot. Perfect balance of heat and taste. I highly recommend it.
"Definitely has a unique taste to it. Being that I am a paranoid hot sauce pack rat, I decided to order this. Does have some heat to it. For the person who loves hot sauces, I would for sure add this one to his/her collection."
"I am a hot sauce junkie, and this one is one of the best ones I've ever tried. It is my new favorite, and I use it on everything. It is especially good on eggs."
It has a unique & delicious flavor that I have not experienced with any other hot sauce.
Excellent hot sauce. Has that strong pepper flavor so if you don’t like that be ready but it’s good.
Love it!it has some heat and very flavorful i will definitely prder more!
"You've got to admit the name on the label gets your attention but inside the bottle is an excellent hot sauce, quite hot but not overbearing and has a nice slightly smoky flavor as well. I tried it on a burrito and kept reaching for more of it! I will try it with my morning eggs and other items that I usually put hot sauce on for added fire and flavor. Enjoyed this hot sauce very much!"
Some of the best hot sauce we've had in a while! Excellent flavor profile and definitely up there on the heat scale!! We're sure to keep this brand on hand at all times.
Not only is this hilarious but this sauce has a great taste. Fast shipping. Great novelty gift but also has a good kick and flavor if you're into the burn.
"Very nice sauce!!! Right amount of heat, great flavor!!! This was my first bottle, will not be the last. "
"VERY Good Hot Sauce. The first few seconds it isn't hot at all, then you get about 4-5 seconds of a really HOT, but ""sweet"" sensation, and then it just disappears. We REALLY loved it in our soup and Deviled Eggs."
"Absolutely delicious. You can tell there is real care put into this sauce. It's hot, but the flavor is phenominal, has those fruity flavors in it, the sweetness, the savory flavors, everything. So well rounded and effective. May imbue you with great strength and warmth. May make you want to walk in the snow wearing only your underwear and your favorite Kalashnikov. May make you want to avenge your boy, all of our boy, Steve, shout out to Bindi and the magic of the thiccening. Buy this sauce m8. It's damn good."
"Hot and tasty, purchased additional bottles to give to friends and they love it and now order their own!"
What a wonderful tasting sauce with a burn that slowly comes after you eat some. Get some you won’t be sorry 
"Reviews definitely weren't lying, I love this and the 7/10 hot sauce. I use this on stuff I want to give punch like my queso or sloppy joes, put some on some burgers today for friends and we were all sweating pretty good but the flavor really drives this home. I wish the bottle was bigger though. This wont last long at all!"
Excellent taste. ..goes well with most foods. ..advise watch dosage. ..this stuff is hot! !! even a very little will spice it up 
"Very good!! not quite as much heat as some of the blairs that i've tried, but still very hot. amazing flavor. i'm going to have to give their 7/10 hot sauce a try."
Has a real strong kick with a unique pepper taste. Great to add on just about anything if you want to kick it up a notch.
"Definitely not the hottest sauce around but I'd argue that it's the best tasting! It is hot, don't get me wrong. I am used to eating fire. This sauce is the tastiest sauce I've found! Give it a try!"
"Fan-freaking-tastic hot sauce. Serious heat. Great flavor as well. Not just a make you cry sauce. They have a great talent in names, too! ;-)"
Definitely brings the heat! It also has a nice flavor not your average hot sauce by far!!!
"I'm not a hot sauce afficianado or even an enthusiast, but I've been wanting to try hot sauces and venture into the hotter territory of the scoville scale. It has amazing flavor (I'd say a 12/10 ;) ) and the heat isn't overpowering, but it is definitely hot. I would definitely buy again."
"Excellent sauce with just the right amount of heat. While some sauces try to knock you out with overwhelming heat, this one has a great flavor with it. I've been trying it with eggs, fish, tacos, and other dishes and it makes everything taste just a bit better."
This stuff is the best I put it on everything it just makes everything taste better also it's F#%$ing hot I have already ordered 2 more bottles
Bought this for my husband because he's in love with spice and good flavor. When you open the bottle the sauce smells amazing! It definitely has that spicy kick but it's delicious. Worth the money! 
I consider myself a hot sauce aficionado and this is an absolutely amazing hot sauce! I even let my friend try it who also loves hot sauce and he said Bunsters is the best he's ever tasted. I don't think I could ever use another hot sauce again.
"I put this stuff on my eggs, on cheese and crackers, on dry sausages, or anything I feel like. It's hot, but tastes great. Not a melt-your-face-off kind of heat, but my days of doing that stuff are long gone."
"I've found my new favorite hot sauce! This stuff is spectacular. First of all, you can't beat the name, but the sauce is more than just a fun name. It's delicious. I've been getting into some really high-intensity hot sauces lately (The Bomb, Mad Dog 357, Blair's Megadeath), and this one isn't quite as hot as those because it doesn't have concentrates in it, but man is it delicious. I glob it on meat, eggs, and dab it on chips from time to time. Granted, it's no lightweight. If you have enough of it, you'll sweat bullets for a good half hour, but when all is said and done, you still have your taste buds. The best part? They give you double what most other hot sauce companies sell you."
Brilliant. It definitely takes eating to a higher level. I am wide awake when eating food with this wicked sauce on it. A little goes a long way. But what is life without going a long way? You will find what you are looking for with this.
Put on some carne asada fries that make and took it to a pot luck at a friends house and it killed. The heat was just enough to burn but not to the point where it hurts the flavor ( which is phenomenal btw). Everyone wanted to know what the sauce was and had a good laugh when I told them the name. 10/10 would buy again
This is surprisingly tasty and hot- just the right combination to fight fire with fire. I love this sauce and everybody I shared it with say this is the best.
"Based on reviews, we purchased three bottles of the 12/10. I cannot speak for myself, as I am intolerant of heat, but my husband and the two recipients of this gift LOVED it. My husband originally thought it was just a funny gag product -- that is, until he tasted it!! He found it interesting that orange juice is the first ingredient listed; he said it gave the sauce a nice flavor. Pricey bottles, but worth it, especially considering that these ship from Perth. We will be back for more!!"
"I got this for my dad. Nothing is too hot for him. He loves it, and Mom says he is putting it on everything. My mom also said she put her finger in it to try a dab of it and instantly regretted it."
"Purchased for a loved one who is crazy about hot sauce -- found out they have had it before, and actually purchased it several times because the flavor is so delicious. Thank you for producing a great product! "
"Nice and Hot, I love to mix it in with something. Excellent flavor and excellent heat. It gives any sauce an extra kick and makes your soups really come to life. I really like how this taste and will buy it again. This is not your typical store bought hot sauce like ""red hot"" or ""tabasco"" this has great flavor and ten times the heat."
"Spicier than I expected. I have never had a hot sauce quite like this, I love it! Very unique."
"My daughter, who thinks that nothing is too hot.........said that a taste ""smaller than a droplet"" caused her pain. None of her co-workers would even try it after that. It's a success. I can't wait to try it on more of my ""the hotter the better"" friends!! Thanks!! By the way, your Quokkas are adorable!!"
"Hot, but the flavor is not lost in the heat. We eat it on literally everything from sushi to steak,EVERYTHING. I give it as gifts instead of a bottle of wine, but wrap it in a newborn diaper as a gift wrap. People love it! I have personally consumed bottles. You'll never taste anything like it"
"Best hot sauce ever. My daughter's favorite sauce which she puts on just about anything. Better than Sriracha, Tabasco, Tapatio, and Redhot."
Not a lot of subtlety here. Just hot as hell! Makes a great gift for friends and enemies alike!
Tasty hot sauce! Great on food but a bit too spicy for me. 10/10 should be perfect for a hot sauce lover that isn't into ultra spicy. 
"i like spicy sauces. i can take some heat. this sauce is _hot_. like, hiccups sometimes hot. like to use in my mexican style foods."
Good tasting. Extremely spicy but not overly punishing. Put a teaspoon on something and your mouth will feel it for the next 10 minutes.
"Delicious. Not as hot as the label indicates, which to some like me, is a good thing. I would recommend to the company that they put a shaker-cap on the top of the bottle. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, but will ruin your meal if it's poured all over the food."
"This sauce has some heat and great flavor, but I wouldn't say it's a12/10...more like a 7/10. I made one pot of chili (6 servings) and have used half the bottle."
"Definitely not a 12/10 on heat, probably 5/10 on heat. Great flavor though, a nice sweet and smoky sauce. "
"Very flavorful with a really good amount of heat, but I'm a complete freak who can handle even hotter so, although I find this to be a very very good hot sauce, I can still drink it straight from the bottle. Probably 98 out of 100 couldn't do that as it does have a nice kick to it but next time I'm going to order the hotter one. Had to get it because of the name, we play a dice game called s*** the bed"
"Great flavor. No one ingredient over powers the other. Pairs well with a wide range of food including Hot Pockets, beef jerky, Taco Bell drunkenly purchased at 2AM, CHEAP bourbon whiskey, and my girlfriend's ""cooking"". For real chile heads, the 12/10 heat is mild."
